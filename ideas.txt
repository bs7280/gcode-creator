todo:
make a bar on the right that will contain polygon sets
make ability to add points to polygons
make deafault polygons like right triangles and stuff
move around points
curves

Idea: lock points in place.
also, maybe I should make it so that the points are squares, that way it
is way faster to calculate if the mouse clicked on a point

make it so mid points will not form when the segment is smaller than a certain size.
also, when two points are dragged onto each other, the dragged point should be removed.
I also need a way to make drilling patterns that do not follow a polygon.
Also, a backward gcode editor. Enter gcode, then edit it. but that would be pretty hard.

move the entire shape (find midpoint the same way you find Center of gravity)

have button/keyboard command/or something that lets the user add a new shape, then 
click 3 points, and the shape is created.

on the gui, there should be a button to copy polygons and on each polygon, a button to flip
horizontally/vertically. then somewhere there will ne buttons to create a perfect right triangle
or perfect whatever shape automatically, with options to type in a new value for a point.
or at least maybe an option to manually change all points.

Note: polygons can actually be just one point (a hole) or
two points (a line)
