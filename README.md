# gcode-creator
a simple webpage that uses javascript and an html5 canvas to create 2d objects and generate gcode for a cnc machine

Note: this is a legacy project that I stopped working on a few years ago, but I am putting it online now for the sake of keeping the project.

If you want to run this project, clone it, then simply open up the html page.
